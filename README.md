# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
This repository contains code and resources for the Titanic Kaggle competition, where the goal is to predict passenger survival aboard the Titanic based on passenger data (such as age, sex, passenger class, etc.).

# Overview
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community. It consists of passenger information such as name, age, sex, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether they survived or not. The task is to analyze the data, train machine learning models, and predict whether a given passenger survived or not.

# Files
train.csv: This file contains the training dataset, which includes features and the target variable (Survived).
test.csv: This file contains the test dataset, which includes features but not the target variable (Survived). The goal is to predict the survival outcome for these passengers.
titanic.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
submission.csv: This file contains the predictions made by the trained model on the test dataset. This file is submitted to Kaggle for evaluation.
